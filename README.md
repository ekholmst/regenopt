# regenopt

A method and code for optimizing the regeneration of a spruce-dominated stand infected by Heterobasidion root rot disease. Please see the publication by E. Holmstr√∂m et al. (in preparation) for details.

NB! Example stand (.csv) coming soon.

NB! If you are the owner of the harvester data and use this code, we strongly encourage you to share information on the location of root-rot infested areas within the stand with the forest owner.
